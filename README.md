### Galaxy Canvas üåå
Galaxy Canvas is an interactive web app designed for generating and colorizing galaxy images. It utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, including GANs and U-Nets, to create realistic galaxies and bring black-and-white galaxy images to life. This project leverages WGAN-GP for galaxy generation and Pix2Pix for galaxy colorization.

### üöÄ Key Features
1. **Galaxy Generator**: Uses a WGAN-GP model to generate realistic galaxy images from random noise.
2. **Galaxy Colorizer**: Transforms grayscale galaxy images into colorized versions using a U-Net model trained on galaxy data.
3. **Image Saving**: Automatically saves generated galaxies and processed images for future reference.
4. **Interactive Web App**: Built using Streamlit, allowing easy interaction for generating and colorizing images.
5. **API Support**: The backend is powered by FastAPI, providing endpoints for galaxy generation and image colorization.

### üõ†Ô∏è Training Details

#### Dataset
The model was trained on Galaxy Zoo dataset images, which were preprocessed and augmented. The dataset includes galaxies, stars, and quasars, with labeled data for various tasks like image colorization and classification.

#### Model Architecture
1. **WGAN-GP**: A type of Generative Adversarial Network used to generate galaxy images.
2. **Pix2Pix U-Net**: A U-Net model for image-to-image translation, used here for coloring grayscale galaxy images.
3. **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling.
4. **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) for WGAN-GP and a combination of L1 loss and adversarial loss for Pix2Pix.

#### Training Pipeline
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Images were resized, normalized, and augmented.
  - Grayscale galaxy images were used for colorization.
- **Callbacks**:
  - Model checkpointing to save the best model.
  - Early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- **Metrics**:
  - PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) for image quality evaluation.
